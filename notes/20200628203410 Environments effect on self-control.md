When it comes to self-control, the environment is a more dominant factor then your willpower. If you don't have any candy or junkfood at home, you _can't_ eat any.

Same way you don't need willpower do do something you wanted to do anyway. A good indication that you are on a smooth track is, not having willpower, but not having to use willpower. (S. Ahrens 2017, 5)

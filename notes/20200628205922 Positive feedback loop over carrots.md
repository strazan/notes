# Positive feedback loop over carrots

External rewards, "carrots", aren't sustainable in the long run. These are dangerous shot term solutions which won't create a positive feedback loop, which is something to strive for. If the work itself is rewarding, motivation and reward becomes self-sustaining and pushed the project forward with ease (S. Ahrens 2017).

This indicates that productivity will come more naturally if you enjoy what you're doing.

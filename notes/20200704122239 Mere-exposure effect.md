We believe we improve at something the more we do it. Once we familiarize with something the brain create the delusional idea that we also understand it. We also tend to like this something more (S. Ahrens 2017). 

The only way to know whether we understand something or just *think* we understand something is to test ourselves. Seek feedback (ibid).

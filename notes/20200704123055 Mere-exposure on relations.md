# Mere-exposure on relations?

[[20200704122239]] Mere-exposure effect

Is the mere-exposure effect applicable to relations? Do we think we like someone more because of exposure, or is human relations too complex and other factors more important? 

Can we then test if we actually like someone or if we just think we like someone? Is there a difference? 

All publicity is good publicity?

# Don't start with brainstorming

Brainstorming is a very popular and common approach when it comes to writing. If you don't have any external notes, the brain is the only place to turn to. But this isn't very cleaver since the brain is neither objective nor reliable. 

This is surprisingly odd due to the fact that most of our ideas comes from elsewhere. From external sources such as reading, discussing or listening to others. (S. Ahrens 2017,)

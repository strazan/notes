# Writing for learning

Formulating your own words in written format is a crucial part of leaning, especially if you really want to understand something, for the long run. One can think internally as much as one wants, but for true learning to take place one needs to externalize those thought (S. Ahrens 2017).

Writing what you learn down gives you a higher probability of understanding it and remember it.

Do it deliberately.
